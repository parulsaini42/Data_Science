    "\n",
    "**In a one-tailed test, you are testing in one direction**, meaning it is tested either if the mean return from A is significantly greater or significantly less than the mean return from B. In this case, the alternative hypothesis would change to:\n",

    "### 2. Select a test statistic\n",
    "A test statistic is a numerical value calculated from a sample of data, often used in hypothesis testing. It serves as a basis for making decisions about whether to accept or reject a null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, the test statistic measures the difference between the observed data and what would be expected under the null hypothesis. The selection of the test statistic is dependent on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parametric vs. non-parametric\n",
    "- Number of samples (one, two, multiple)\n",
    "- Discrete (e.g. number of customers) or continuous variable (e.g. order value)\n",
    "\n",
    "eg. t-test, z-test, or F-test, which all assume a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of test statistic depends on the hypothesis being tested and the nature of the data. Different statistical tests use different test statistics. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a t-test, the test statistic is the t-value, which measures the difference between the means of two groups relative to the variability within the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a chi-square test, the test statistic is the chi-square statistic, which measures the discrepancy between the observed and expected frequencies of categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In regression analysis, the test statistic can be the F-statistic, which tests the overall significance of the regression model, or the t-statistic for individual coefficients, which tests the significance of each predictor variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the test statistic is calculated, it is compared to a critical value or p-value to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the test statistic is sufficiently extreme (i.e., falls into the rejection region), the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the test statistic is not extreme enough, the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n"

    "\n",
    "When testing hypotheses, we cannot always test it on the whole population but only on randomly selected data samples. Therefore we cannot assume 100% true conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of errors that we can make:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type I error: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Alpha is prob of type 1 error. Lower value is preferred\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type II error: Accepting the null hypothesis when it is false. Beta (power of a test) is the probability of the type 2 error. The lower the beta, the higher the power. \n",
